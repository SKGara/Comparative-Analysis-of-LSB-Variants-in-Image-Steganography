# Comparative-Analysis-of-LSB-Variants-in-Image-Steganography

Description: Designed and implemented five image steganography techniques: Basic 1-bit LSB, 2-bit LSB, LSB-Matching, Adaptive LSB, and Edge-Based LSB. Evaluated their effectiveness using PSNR and SSIM metrics.
Key Contributions:
Developed algorithms for encoding and decoding secret messages in images using Python and libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL.
Conducted comparative analysis of image quality post-embedding, leveraging visualization tools like Matplotlib.
Incorporated edge detection and adaptive techniques to optimize data hiding in high-intensity regions.
Built an interactive widget-based framework for dynamic steganography experimentation.
Outcome: Achieved detailed insights into the trade-offs between embedding capacity and image quality, contributing to the understanding of secure data hiding techniques.
